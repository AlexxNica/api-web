The files in this directory are used by Evolution 3.6 and later to
automatically configure email accounts.  This so that you can tell it,
"My mail is example@gmail.com" and it will automatically figure out that
it must use imap.googlemail.com and smtp.googlemail.com.

The files in this directory use the <clientConfig version="1.1"> format,
whereas files in the parent directory use the initial <clientConfig> format.
As far as I can tell, there's merely some naming differences between the two.

The files themselves need to be named after an authoritative name server
for the domains listed in the file, based on the domain's MX record in DNS.

For example:

  $ dig mx rocketmail.com

  ; <<>> DiG 9.8.1-P1 <<>> mx rocketmail.com
  ;; global options: +cmd
  ;; Got answer:
  ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 4974
  ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 5, AUTHORITY: 5, ADDITIONAL: 16

  ;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
  rocketmail.com.		29284	IN	NS	ns1.yahoo.com.
  rocketmail.com.		29284	IN	NS	ns5.yahoo.com.

  rocketmail.com.		29284	IN	NS	ns4.yahoo.com.

Evolution will perform its own MX record lookup, extract one of the name
server (NS) records from the authority section as shown above, and then
pare down the name server's host name until it gets a match like so:

  http://api.gnome.org/evolution/autoconfig/1.1/ns1.yahoo.com : NOT FOUND
  http://api.gnome.org/evolution/autoconfig/1.1/yahoo.com     : FOUND!

Run the test-nameservers.py script periodically to verify symbolic links
for authoritative name server domains.
